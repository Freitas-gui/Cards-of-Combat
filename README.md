# Cards-of-Combat
It is a web application planned by me, where I perform the CRUD of Naruto anime cards, a card has:
name, image, description, level, attack and defense.
In addition to CRUD, I implement other features such as:
search for letters by name and level, analyze details of an isolation letter and the entire verification system to validate forms with personalized messages.
